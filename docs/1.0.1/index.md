# Shunter Documentation

Welcome to the Shunter documentation. Shunter is a Node.js application built to read JSON and translate it into HTML.

For new users, we recommend reading the [Shunter Introduction](introduction.html) followed by the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.html).

If you're looking for the full documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](usage/index.html).

If you're interested in contributing to Shunter, we also maintain a [developer guide](developer-guide.html).
